		<h3>Where did they get their name from?</h3>
		<img src="caspian.jpg" width="126" height="189" alt="an image of the three members of the Caspian Trio">
		<p>
		The Caspian Trio was named after this epic dude. His name is... you guessed it! Caspian! 
		The reason why the Caspian Trio is named after Caspian is because whenever the trio practises, Caspian sits and listens very attentively (sometimes he conducts) and then claps at the end.
